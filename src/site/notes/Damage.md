# Damage
## Damage Types
There are various damage types that might affect a character.
- Physical: This is the basic and most common damage type. Getting cut by a blade, hit with a hammer, or pierced by an ice sickle
- Chemical: If the setting has anything resembling chemistry then it will have chemical damage. Acids, Poisons, toxic clouds.
- Temperate: This is damage comes from changes in temperature. Fire, Frost, Light, Radiation, lightening.
- Mental: This is damage of the mind. Whether from the outside in or the inside out. Mental damage can be caused by many things.
### Damage Reduction
Some items like [[Items/Armor\|Armor]] provides damage reduction. That means every time a character with damage reduction is hit, the amount of damage dealt is reduced by that amount. This damage reduction usually only applies to certain damage types.
### Vulnerabilities and Immunities
Some characters are more or less vulnerable to certain damage types that goes beyond damage reduction.

If a character is immune to a certain damage type, then when it encounters that damage type it takes no damage.

If a character is vulnerable to a certain damage type, then when it encounters that damage type it takes twice as much damage.
