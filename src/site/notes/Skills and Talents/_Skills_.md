# Skills
Skills are the core of Potentulus. Skills are what make every character unique in their own ways.

First you must acquire a new skill. Characters are able to learn new skills by spending [[Skill Points, Leveling Up, and Experience\|skill points]]. The character must spend skills points equal to the number of skills already learned minus their rank in Intellect. 

So if a character has 0 skills, then their first skill costs 0 skill points. Then their second skill costs 1 skill point minus their rank in intellect. As their already know 1 skill and would have at least 1 rank of Intellect, their second skill would also cost 0.

If the character would like a third skill, they would add their two previous skills and subtract their rank in Intellect, 2-1 = 1, so their third skill costs 1 skill point to gain.

Like [[Abilities and Checks \|abilities]], skills can be increased in [[Ranks#Skill Ranks\|rank]] to gain additional effects or change effects from lower ranks.

Skills are formatted like so:

#### **Skill Name** (This is the name of the entire skill)
Rank 1 
	- (This is the rank of a skill that is gained when it is first learned)

Rank 2 (Action, (C), 2)
	-  (This is stating that the effect gained costs 2 stamina to use and is [[Hit Points and Stamina#Continuous Costs\|continuous]])

Rank 3 (Refresh, [[Downtime and Resting\|Half-Rest]])
	-  (This is stating that the effect gained needs a half-rest after being used to use it again)

Rank 4
	- Changes rank 1:  ... (This is stating that this rank changes some part of the previous rank to increase their effects. If there are new effects and changes to old effects in the same rank, they will be separated)

Rank 5 

Rank 6

Rank 7+[[Infinity+\|i]] (Rank for [[Infinity+\|Infinity+]])
