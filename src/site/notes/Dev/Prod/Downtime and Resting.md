# Rests
Everyone needs to rest and take a break now and again. I will show you exact how to do that!
### Rest Definition: 
- A period of time of light activity taken to regain energy and wits. 
	- Light activity cannot contain skill checks that involve high activity and stress. For example, crafting checks using might, highly stressful mental situations, or anything that might exert high amounts of energy as determined by the [[Dev/Game Master\|GM]].
	- Light activity can contain skill checks of low activity or stress. For example, bartering with a merchant, crafting checks that are low stress such as weaving or cooking, or anything that exerts low energy and stress as determined by the [[Dev/Game Master\|GM]].

- #### Full Rest
	- This is a Rest that takes a full day. Anyone who completes a full rest can gain the following.
		- Spend [[Dev/Prod/Skill Points, Leveling Up, and Experience\|Skill Points]]
		- Restore their [[Dev/Prod/Hit Points and Stamina\|Hit Points]] to full
		- Refresh any [[Dev/Prod/Skills and Talents/_Skills_\|_Skills_]] that have a full rest or lower refresh.
- #### Half Rest
	- This is a Rest that takes at least 6 hours and can only be done 3 times before a Full Rest is needed. Anyone who completes a half rest can gain the following.
		- Restore their Hit Points equal to their [[Dev/Prod/Ranks\|Ranks]] in Vitality
		- Refresh any [[Dev/Prod/Skills and Talents/_Skills_\|_Skills_]] that have a half rest or lower refresh.
- #### Break
	- This is a Rest that takes at least 1 hour and can only be done 2 times before at least a half Rest is needed. Anyone who completes a half rest can gain the following.
		- Refresh any [[Dev/Prod/Skills and Talents/_Skills_\|_Skills_]] that have a break refresh.

### Not Resting
Like I said before, ***everyone*** needs to rest every now and then. If anyone decides not to rest, review the following.
- A full day
	- Anyone who decides to not rest in any way for a full day has their maximum stamina reduced by their Rank in Will.
- Two full days
	 - Anyone who decides to not rest for two full days has their maximum stamina reduced 
 
# Downtime
Downtime is any period of low activity. Characters use downtime to do many things. Whether that be [[Dev/Crafting\|crafting]], socializing, a job, or simply taking in the pleasures of life.
