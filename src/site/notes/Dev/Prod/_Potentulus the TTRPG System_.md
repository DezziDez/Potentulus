Welcome to the fully Modular, infinitely scaling, and open-source tabletop role-playing game Potentulus! I'm Coreline, the core rule system.         ヾ(＠⌒▽⌒＠)ﾉ

I only have a few hard rules that you should always follow.
1. Change It! The system is designed to be altered. Put rules in, take rules out, or change them into something else. Nothing is marked as optional because everything is optional.
2. Make it! If the rules don't support what you want, make your own! The system is completely modular and open-source, so add anything you like and even share it with the world.
3. Break it! Whether player or game master, do whatever you want. The system wants to be bent and broken. Go wild and make the craziest of characters, encounters, items, beastie, or whatever insanity you can come up with.

You will notice that this entire system is inside a, potentially strange, system of pages. I was designed and built inside Obsidian to be plain text, modular, and interconnected. Whenever you see a linked item, it will take you to that page to give you more information!

## Terminology
There are certain words used in this system that are used to convey information as simply as possible. Here are the major ones to assist in reading this system.

#### Character
Everyone is a character. From the snarling wolves to the people the players are playing. The word character refers to any living individual that might make some kind of choice in your world. This word was chosen for its neutral and all-encompassing form.


## Mission Statement
The original goal of this system was to make something that anyone could pick up and play. To give a fully customized experience with as little overhead as possible.

The rules are designed to be easy to wrap your head around and to be fully explained so there aren't any questions. But, still be complex enough to be interesting to players more familiar with more rules-heavy systems.

I also wanted the system to scale up indefinitely in both power and complexity. To allow players to start off simple but get more and more complex interactions as the game progresses. Easing players into the idea of complexity instead of throwing them in all at once.

While I am not sure if I succeeded in these goals I can sincerely say that an effort was made. And I really hope you enjoy playing and making anything from your imagination with this tool that is Potentulus.
