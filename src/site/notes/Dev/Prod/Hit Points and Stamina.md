# Hit Points
Every character has hit points. These hit points determine how much punishment anyone can take at any one time.

The maximum number of hit points a character has is calculated by adding their rank in Vitality twice and then adding their rank in Will twice. 

For example, if you have 3 ranks in Vitality and 2 ranks in Will, you would add Vitality twice, 3+3 = 6. Then add your Will twice, 2+2 = 4. Then add those together, 6+4 = 10. In this example, you would have 10 hit points.

# Stamina
Every character has stamina. This is the fuel for action and represents the amount of evergy a character has.

The maximum number of stamina a character has is calculated by adding their rank in Vitality twice and then adding their rank in Agility twice. The primary difference between stamina and hit points is how they are used and regained.

Whenever a character uses an [[Dev/Prod/Basic Actions\|action]] they consume stamina. A basic action uses 1 stamina and some skill actions cost more stamina to be used. Additionally, using more actions costs more stamina by adding the number of actions that have been used by the character this round to the cost of the next action.

For example, if you were to use 3 basic actions, your next basic action would cost 1+3 = 4 stamina.

A expended stamina is regained at the beginning of the character's turn.
