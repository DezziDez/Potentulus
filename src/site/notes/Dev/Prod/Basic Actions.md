# Basic Actions
There are skills that any character can take no matter what skills or background they have. These are known as basic actions. These basic actions cost one [[Dev/Stamina\|Stamina]] to perform.

Attack:
- An attack is using your body and mind to hurt another character. This takes the form of an ability check.
- If using a weapon it would be the required ability for the weapon plus the weapon's die. For example, if the required ability for the weapon is might and the weapon has a 1d4 as the weapon die, then the check would be might+1d4.
- if using no weapon, also known as a bare attack, it would be Might+Agility.

Move:
- Every character has a speed stat. When taking the move action, the character can move up to a number of tiles equal to their speed.
- When moving through difficult areas or climbing, the character is slowed.

Help:
- Helping is doing something to aid or assist another character.
- Helping can take the form of giving an advantage to an attack, picking up an character who is prone, or backing up someone's argument.

Manipulate:
- Manipulate is using force to move objects or characters.
- Manipulate can be used to invoke a contest to grapple a target. This requires both hands to be free and requires a might+agility check against a might+agility check of the characters being grappled.
- Manipulate can be used to push or pull objects or characters. This requires at least one free hand and requires a might+might check.
- A characters cannot manipulate an object or character that is a size or more larger than themselves.

Throw:
- A character can throw anything they are currently holding/grappling.
- An object of bulk 0 can be thrown a number of tiles equal to twice the characters might rank. An object of bulk 1 can be thrown a number of tiles equal to their might. An object of bulk 2 can be thrown 1 tile.

Free action (No Cost)
