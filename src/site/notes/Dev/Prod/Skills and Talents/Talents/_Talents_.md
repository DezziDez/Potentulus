# Talents
Talents are a special type of [[Dev/Prod/Skills and Talents/_Skills_\|skill]] that can only be acquired through special circumstances.

Talents are exactly as they sound. They are skills or abilities that a character naturally has that did not take work or training to acquire. However they acquired talents whether by the character's lineage, culture, background, bio-engineering, or mystical event. Talents are a part of them and they can be increased in rank and grown like any other skill.

A character starts with 4 talents relating to their character and they do not count towards the number of skills that a character knows.

Talents cannot be taken as regular skills. They can only be gained during character creation. However, a character does not need to fill their talent slots with only skills marked as talent, a talent slot can be filled with any type of skill.
