# Skills
Skills are the core of Potentulus. Skills are what make every character unique in their own ways.

First you must acquire a new skill. Every character has at least one skill in the form of a an intellect skill. Intellect skills are a type of skill that are gained by having a high intellect. For every rank of intellect a character has, they can gain one intellect skill.

If a character wants to gain a new skill by spending [[Dev/Prod/Skill Points, Leveling Up, and Experience\|skill points]] they must skills points equal to the number of skills already learned. So if a character has 0 skills, then their first skill costs 0 skill points. Then their second skill costs 1 skill points as their already know 1 skill. Intellect skills are not counted here.

Like [[Abilities and Checks \|abilities]] skills can be increased in [[Dev/Prod/Ranks\|rank]] to gain additional actions, abilities, or change effects from lower ranks.

Skills are formatted like so:

**Skill Name** (This is the name of the entire skill)
	Rank 1 (This is the rank of a skill that is gained when it is first learned)
	Rank 2
	- Action(2) (This is stating that the effect gained costs 2 stamina to use)
	Rank 3
	- Refresh(Half-Rest) (This is stating that the effect gained needs a half rest after being used to use it again)
	Rank 4
	- This rank changes rank 1 and rank 2.... (This is stating that this rank changes some part of the previous rank to increase their effects. If there are new effects and changes to old effects in the same rank, they will be separated)
	Rank 5
	Rank 6
	Rank 7+[[Dev/Prod/Infinity+\|i]] (Rank for [[Dev/Prod/Infinity+\|Infinity+]])
