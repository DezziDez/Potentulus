# Infinity +
You may notice that there are some charts that have an additional bit at the end label with a +i. This stands for infinity. This system was designed, if desired, to scale infinitely. The equations for infinity plus are more complicated than the regular dice rolls, so it is generally not recommended that you use infinity plus rules unless you already have a firm understanding of the system or are familiar with more complicated systems.

The **i** not only means infinity, it is also a variable. It represents any number of values greater or equal to than the value and equation shown and the value shown should be used as a base.

Like all rules in this game, infinity plus can simply be ignored. It is not required to enjoy this system.
