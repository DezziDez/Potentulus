# Sizes
Every character has a size category. This size determines the number of tiles they take up on a map and gives a rough idea as to if they could or could not fit into any given space.

The size of a character can be measured out by the number of tiles the character takes up on a battle map. As battle maps are measured in tiles, to determine the size of a creature based on their size category you can count the number of tiles in a straight line that the creature would take up.

If a character wants to increase by 1 size or decrease by 1 size, you simple add or subtract 2 tiles in a straight line. This does mean there is no limit to how large a character could be.

Characters have the bulk of items reduced by 1 for every size above medium. As a character gets larger they will become able to carry items that would normally be impossible for smaller creatures.

| Size       | Tiles | 
| ---------- | ----- |
| Small      | 0.5   |
| Medium     | 1     |
| Large      | 3     |
| Huge       | 5     |
| Massive    | 7     |
| Gargantuan | 9     |
| Colossal   | 11    |
