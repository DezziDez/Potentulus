# Basic Actions
There are skills that any character can take no matter what skills or background they have. These are known as basic actions. These basic actions cost 2 [[Hit Points and Stamina#Stamina\|stamina]] to perform.

Attack:
- Every character can attack another character using their bodies and/or weapons.
- If the character is using a weapon the damage dealt would be the required ability for the weapon plus the weapon's die. For example, if the required ability for the weapon is might and the weapon has a 1d4 as the weapon die, then the check would be might+1d4.
- If the character is not using a weapon, also known as a natural attack, it would be Might+Agility.

Move:
- Every character has a speed stat. When taking the move action, the character can move up to a number of tiles equal to their speed.
- When moving through difficult areas or climbing, the character gains 1 [[Conditions#^39cd09\|stack of slowed]].

Help:
- Helping is doing something to aid or assist another character.
- Helping can take the form of giving an advantage to an attack, picking up an character who is prone, backing up someone's argument, or trying to [[Hit Points and Stamina#Hitting 0\|save another character from death]].

Manipulate:
- Manipulate is using force to move objects or characters.
- Manipulate can be used to invoke a contest to grapple a target. This requires both hands to be free and requires a might+agility check against a might+agility check of the characters being grappled.
- Manipulate can be used to push or pull objects or characters. This requires at least 1 free hand and requires a might+might check.
- Characters cannot manipulate an object or character that is 1 size or more larger than themselves.

Throw:
{ #9a1b92}

- A character can throw anything they are currently holding/grappling.
- An object of bulk 0 can be thrown a number of tiles equal to twice the characters rank in Might. 
- An object of bulk 1 can be thrown a number of tiles equal to their rank in Might. 
- An object of bulk 2 can be thrown 1 tile.

Free action (No Cost/1)
- Every character gets 1 free action.
- A free action is any task that takes time but not energy. Equipping/unequipping/ swapping your items. Studying an enemy. Using an item or object. Reloading a ranged weapon.
- If a character wishes to use more than one free action, it would cost 1 stamina like any other basic action.
