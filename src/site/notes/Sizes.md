# Sizes
Every character has a size category. This size determines the number of tiles they take up on a map and gives a rough idea as to if they could or could not fit into any given space.

The size of a character can be measured out by the number of tiles the character takes up on a battle map. As battle maps are measured in tiles, to determine the size of a character based on their size category you can count the number of tiles in a straight line that the character would take up.

If a character wants to increase by 1 size or decrease by 1 size, you simple add or subtract 2 tiles in a straight line. This does mean there is no limit to how large a character could be.

| Size       | Tiles | 
| ---------- | ----- |
| Small      | 0.5   |
| Medium     | 1     |
| Large      | 3     |
| Huge       | 5     |
| Massive    | 7     |
| Gargantuan | 9     |
| Colossal   | 11    |

## Ups and Downs
Character gains various benefits and restrictions from being larger or smaller.

Carry capacity:
As character get bigger or smaller, they gain or lose [[Items/Carry Capacity\|Carry Capacity]]. The base bulk of an item is relative to medium sized characters.
	- Larger than medium: The bulk of items reduced by 1 to at least 0 for every size above medium. Including items that would normally be impossible to carry due to bulks higher than 2.
	- Smaller than medium: The bulk of items increases by 1 for every below medium. This may make some items impossible to carry due to having bulks higher than 2.
