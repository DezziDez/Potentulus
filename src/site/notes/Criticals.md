# Criticals
A critical or crit is an extreme of high or lows that drives tension and add potential swingy-ness to a game.

## Critical Success
A critical success is when an ability check or an attack roll is made and both dice land on their maximum value. When this happens, the total roll is doubled, potentially making the roll a success or dealing twice as much damage if that roll was an attack.

Some additional event may occur due to a critical success based on the situation. This is known as a brutal critical success and it is up to the GM to determine the outcome of the great success.
## Critical Failure
A critical failure is when an ability check or an attack roll is made and both dice land on 1. When this happens the check automatically fails and no damage is dealt if that roll was an attack.

Some additional event may occur due to a critical failure based on the situation. This is known as a brutal critical fail and it is up to the GM to determine the outcome of the great failure.

## Advantages and Disadvantages with Criticals
Some skills, conditions, or situations may give characters [[Advantage and Disadvantage\|advantages or disadvantages]] on their rolls. Generally, if two of either were to force a critical in either direction, the critical should not be counted.

Example 1: If a character had two disadvantages, they would be guaranteed to have two natural 1s. In this case, that would not trigger a critical failure. Same goes with advantages and a critical success.

Example 2: If a character had one disadvantage, they would be guaranteed to have one natural 1. In this case, that would trigger a critical failure if they rolled another natural one on their other die. Same goes with advantages and a critical success.
