# Potentulus the TTRPG System
Welcome to Potentulus, the fully Modular and open-source tabletop role-playing system. I'm Dez and I'll be walking you through everything here!

There are only have a few hard rules that you should always follow.
1. **Change It!** The system is designed to be altered. Put rules in, take rules out, or change them into something else. Nothing is marked as optional because everything is optional.
2. **Make it!** If the rules don't support what you want, make your own! The system is completely modular and open-source, so add anything you like and even share it with the world.
3. **Break it!** Whether player or game master, do whatever you want. The system wants to be bent and broken. Go wild and make the craziest of characters, encounters, items, beasts, or whatever insanity you can come up with.

You will notice that this entire system is inside a, *potentially strange*, system of pages. I designed and built this entire system inside Obsidian to be plain text, modular, and interconnected. Whenever you see a linked item you can click or hover over it and it will take you to that page to give you more information!

You can also search this entire document with the built in search function to find what you're looking for or use the hierarchy on the left to dig around.

## Notes and Things to Know
There are words or concepts that are good to understand and be aware of right out of the gate.

#### Concept: Simplicity Over Flavor
This is a concept that this system sticks to through its entirety. The system is designed to be entirely setting agnostic and that means that every item and skill is nearly entirely flavorless. Bland yes but with untold possibilities. The system is designed for flavor and setting to come from the group (GM and Players). So get creative!

#### Definition: Game Master (GM)
{ #454d89}


The game master is the person who runs the game and simulates the world. The GM decides what rules from this system the game uses and makes rulings on how the game works. Game master is a position of trust and it is important that communication between the players and GM is maintained.

#### Definition: Character
Everyone is a character. From the snarling wolves to the people the players are playing. The word character refers to any living individual that might make some kind of choice in your world. This word was chosen for its neutral and all-encompassing form.

#### Definition: Target
In some skills, conditions, and items there is something referenced called a target. A target is simply anything that can be targeted such as a character, an object, or the environment.

### Q & A
Q: It's open source? Where is it?
A: It's all located on this github https://github.com/DezziDez/Potentulus feel free to make a pull request to suggest features.

Q: Is there a discord or community I can join to talk about this system?
A: No. And there probably won't be anything made officially. Feel free to make your own though.

## Mission Statement
I originally built this system to make something that anyone could pick up, understand, and play with minimal knowledge of math, system overhead, and full creative freedom.

I wanted something setting agnostic that didn't box you in or tell you how to think. I wanted the system to be simple on the surface but get more complex as you get deeper, easing new players into the idea of more and more complex character. Allowing you to play and make good choices without knowing all the rules but still grow and learn along the way.

I also wanted the system and its mechanics to be able to scale up indefinitely to allow for the biggest bosses and highest power fantasies.

All of this is a very difficult balance, like dancing on a tightrope. And while I am not sure if I succeeded in these goals I can sincerely say that an effort was made. And I really hope you enjoy playing and making anything from your imagination with this tool that is Potentulus.

-Dez, The Creator
