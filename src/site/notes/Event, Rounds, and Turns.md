# Event, Rounds, and Turns
When performing actions in Potentulus all characters must act, react, and make choices in short periods of time. This amount of time is broken down into Events, Rounds, and Turns.

An event is a period of time made up of rounds, the amount of time that an event takes is only determined by the amount of rounds it takes to complete the event.

A round is 10 seconds of time that all characters share at once. Rounds are made up of turns that every character has in a certain order.

When an event begins all characters in the event roll for their initiative ([[Abilities and Checks\|Agility+Intellect]]), this determines the order that the characters will take their turns in any given round. The higher the number the faster that character is able to act and react at that time.

The beginning of a round is tracked as the highest point in the turn order. Nothing can be higher than the beginning of the round and any effect that occurs on the beginning of the round always happens first. If more than one effect occurs at the beginning of the round, the GM determines what order they trigger.

A turn is a characters personal slice of their subjective 10 second round. At the beginning of a round, all characters may choose to have their initiative be lower than their roll, also known as waiting. Resetting back to its original point at the beginning of the next round.

## Turn Phases
Beginning of Turn:
- Whenever a character begins their turn their [[Hit Points and Stamina\|stamina]] resets back to its maximum and the cost of their last action becomes 0.
- Beginning of turn effects trigger. These effects can trigger in any order the effecting character chooses for them to trigger.
- *Note: Beginning of turn effects are always positive or neutral to the character.*
Middle of Turn:
- The player chooses what [[Basic Actions\|actions]] to take if any during their turn.
End of Turn:
- When a player ends their turn they cannot take any [[Hit Points and Stamina#Quick Actions\|quick actions]] during this phase.
- End of turn effects trigger. These effects trigger in the order the GM chooses for them to trigger.
- Note: End of turn effects are always negative or neutral to the character.
## Ties
If two character roll initiative and a tie occurs then the GM decides who is higher in the initiative.
