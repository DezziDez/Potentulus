# Abilities
All characters have natural abilities. These abilities come in 6 forms.
- Might
	- This is the conscious ability to exert physical force using your body. Lifting, Moving, Hitting, etc... 
- Agility
	- This is the unconscious ability to move or think with speed. To act, react, and strike when and where it is needed most.
- Vitality
	- This is life force, the unconscious will to live. This is what keeps everyone alive when they are in danger.
- Intellect
	- This is the conscious ability to think, keep sharp in complex situations, or to remember important information.
- Insight
	- This is the ability to see the unseen or understand emotions. This is unconscious thought that gives intuition and knowledge of surroundings.
- Will
	- This is the conscious will to live. The driving force in everyone to keep moving forward.

Every ability has a number of ranks, starting at rank 1 and going all the way to rank 6. See [[Ranks\|Ranks]] for more information.

# Ability Checks
Whenever an ability check needs to be made, the character takes the two abilities required for the check and rolls the dice for those two abilities then adds the result together.

For example: If a character wanted to make a Perception check, they would likely need to make an Agility + Insight check. If the character had a 1d6 in agility and 1d4 in insight, they would roll 1d6+1d4 and add the result.

See the table below for **examples** of what different ability checks might represent. Though this system is designed for the GM to make the call on what check is needed for any given situation. Unless a check is specified in an action, it is not a hard rule. And even then the GM has the right to change the required check.

# Contests
All ability checks are contests of some form. Whether that contest be with another character or the environment.

A contest with another character is relatively straightforward. A character makes a check to gain an outcome while the opposing character makes a check to oppose that outcome.
For example: A character wants to detect if another character is lying, they would likely roll a Insight+Intellect check. Then the opposing character would likely make Insight+Will check to try and be convincing regardless if they are lying or not.

Contests with the environment are much more common. They occur when a character is trying to gain some outcome with only the world itself against them. In this case the GM determines the difficulty of the check between, Trivial, Easy, Medium, Hard, Challenging, or Extreme.

Once a difficulty is chosen, the DM rolls two dice of the chosen difficulty. The character now has to contest against the result of the roll. If a more solid number is desired, the averages of the rolls are provided for easy use or reference.

| Difficulty                   | Die                        | Solid Number          |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Trivial                      | 2d2                        | 3                     |
| Easy                         | 2d4                        | 5                     |
| Medium                       | 2d6                        | 7                     |
| Hard                         | 2d8                        | 9                     |
