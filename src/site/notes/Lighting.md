# Lighting
There are many types of light, but the light types that will be encountered most often by any character are as follows from brightest to darkest:
Blinding:
- This type of light is so bright that it is blinding. Blinding light inflicts the blinded [[Conditions\|condition]] on any character that is within its radius. This type of light is usually brief and only blinds creatures temporarily.
Bright:
- Bright light is extremely clear light that fills large areas and adds contrast. Such as sunlight. Characters seeing through bright light gain an advantage on vision based ability checks.
Normal:
- Normal lighting is the average amount of light any character would experience inside a building with light sources or natural lighting from windows.
Low:
- Low lighting is difficult to see in, there is some light but not much. Characters suffer a disadvantage to vision based ability checks while trying to see through it.
Darkness:
- There is absolutely no light here. Characters attempting to see through darkness are blinded.
