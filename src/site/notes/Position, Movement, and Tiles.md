## Tiles
Battle maps, top-down depictions of environments to represent physical interactions, are mainly made up of tiles, aka Hexes. A hex, or hexagon, is a type of battle map that more accurately and quickly represents distance.

To accurately determine the limits of a character, the system assumes 
1 tile = 1 meter  or  1 tile = 3 feet.
## Position
When in a battle or any situation where every edge matters, characters must keep in mind where they are in relation to everyone else.
### Cover
Characters can take cover behind objects to protect themselves. The cover itself though can take the damage and once the cover is destroyed the protection is gone.

Full Cover:
- The character is unseen and sufficiently covered to not be targeted.
- Area of Effect attacks that do not move around corners cannot hit the character.

Partial Cover:
- At least half of the character is sufficiently covered.
- Characters targeting the partially covered character suffer a [[Advantage and Disadvantage\|disadvantage]].

### Range
Some characters fight in melee range while other characters have ranged weapons.

Melee Range
- A character is in melee range when their are within 1 tile of another character. For example, if two medium [[Sizes\|sized]] characters were in an [[Event, Rounds, and Turns\|event]] where they were fighting, they would only be within melee combat of each other if their tokens on the battle map were touching.

Firing Range
- A character's firing range is dependent on their weapon or skill being used. The range shown determines the maximum range the character can fire that weapon.
- The ***GM*** may ***allow*** the character to fire outside of that maximum range with an ability check (Example, a gun would be agility+intellect) and suffer a disadvantage.

Throwing Range
- A character may [[Basic Actions#^9a1b92\|throw]] an object (or character) a certain number of tiles as determined by the objects size and the characters might.
- The ***GM*** may ***allow*** the character to throw outside of that range with an ability check (Example, a might+agility or might+might) and suffer a disadvantage.
## Speed
Every character has a speed stat. This speed determines the amount it can move and how.

A character's speed is determined by adding together their rank in Agility twice and their rank in Might twice. For example, if a character has Rank 2 (1d4) in Agility and Rank 3 (1d6) in Might, the character has 2+2 = 4 (1d4 = 4) and 3+3 = 6 (1d6 = 6) then 4+6=10 speed.

Whenever a character wants to move through a more difficult environment such as swimming, climbing, or moving through bramble. That character suffers 1 stack of [[Conditions#^39cd09\|slowed]], halving their movement or more if they already have stacks of slowed.
