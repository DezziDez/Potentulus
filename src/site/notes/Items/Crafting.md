Characters may spend their [[Downtime and Resting\|downtime]] creating items from raw materials.

If the GM believes a character has the materials and tools to make a certain item, they may attempt to craft that item by determining its difficulty.

At base, items have 2 properties. A basic property and an advanced property.

Crafting an item requires the character to roll the die for the basic property and roll the die for the advanced property. Representing the difficulty to work with the materials at hand and luck. That is then the difficulty to craft the item and the character must make a crafting ability check to craft that item which is different depending on the item material.

Some items have special properties that add additional effects. These properties will have their own ability check associated with them.

After crafting the item the character must determine the rank. Characters without the necessary crafting skills in the chosen material cannot make an item greater than rank 1.
