# Items
There are many items that can be and created by characters. Items are described by their attributes rather than an item describing their attributes.

For example: 
A basic short sword would be a rank 2 one handed weapon with a sharp edge.
Great Axe: A rank 3 great weapon a sharp edge.
Sledge Hammer: A rank 1 two handed weapon with a blunt end
A Spear: A rank 2 two handed weapon with a pointed end.

These attributes can describe any weapon of a similar size and caliber. This method greatly simplifies weapons but allows for maximum flexibility in what is possible.

Items are generally separated by type that describe their function. Weapons, Bags, Tools, Armor
