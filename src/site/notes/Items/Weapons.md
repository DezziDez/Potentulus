# Weapons
There are many weapons that can be and created by characters. Weapons are described by their attributes rather than a weapon describing their attributes.

For example: 
A basic short sword would be a rank 2 one handed bladed weapon.
Great Axe: A rank 3 great bladed weapon.
Sledge Hammer: A rank 1 two handed blunt weapon.
A Spear: A rank 2 two handed pointed weapon.
A Long Bow: A rank 3 two handed ranged weapon.

These attributes can describe any weapon of a similar size and caliber. This method greatly simplifies weapons but allows for maximum flexibility in what is possible.
