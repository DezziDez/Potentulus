# Carry Capacity
All items have a bulk value that can be can be as low as 0 and as high as 2 for medium characters and determines how cumbersome it is.

0 bulk items are items that are negligible in weight and size but still take up space.
1 bulk items are items of considerable size or weight. A character can carry 1 of these in 1 hand.
2 bulk items are items of extreme size or weight. A character needs both hands to carry this item.
3+ bulk items are items impossible for a character to normally carry but may not be impossible to lift temporarily.

Characters possess a number of slots that allows them to carry a certain number of items. certain [[Skills/_Skills_\|skills]] or [[Items/_Items_\|items]] may change this amount, but the default carry capacity works as follows.
##### Armor Slots
Characters that have the ability to wear armor have a single armor slot. Any armor the character is wearing, whether light armor, medium armor, or heavy armor goes into this slot if able. Only 1 set of armor may be equipped into this slot at a time. 

Clothing is considered a type of armor and if clothing and armor are worn at the same time, the armor and clothing are counted in the same slot as clothing is usually more insignificant than the armor. That is unless the character is wearing enough clothing to be counted as light or medium armor.
##### Inventory Slots
Characters have a number of Inventory slots equal to their ranks in might. These are slots that can contain items such as extra clothing, bags, or jewelry. A single inventory slot can hold an item of 1 bulk. An item of 2 bulk requires 2 slots. And 1 slot can hold 4 items of 0 bulk.
##### Equipped Slots
Characters have equipped slots. These are slots that can contain items that are ready to use at a moments notice and is generally represented by the characters hands (or hand like appendages). Characters have 2 equipped slots that function identically to an inventory slot except it is more readily available. Such as a sword and shield.
