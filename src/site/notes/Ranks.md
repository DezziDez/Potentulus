# Ranks
Everything on a character sheet has a rank. Whether that be skills, talents, abilities, or items. The rank of something determines it's strength and everything starts at rank 1. These ranks can be leveled up by spending [[Skill Points, Leveling Up, and Experience \|skill points]]!
# Ability Ranks
The ranks of your [[Abilities and Checks \|abilities]] cost more skill points as you increase them in rank. To increase the rank of an ability you have to spend a number of skill points equal to the next rank. So going from rank 1 to rank 2 requires you to spend 2 skill points. And going from rank 3 to rank 4 you have to spend 4 skill points.
# Skill Ranks
[[Skills and Talents/_Skills_\|Skills]] can be increased in rank just like abilities can. However, when a skill increases in rank it gains power in more interesting ways.
