# Hit Points
Every character has hit points. These hit points determine how much punishment anyone can take at any one time.

The maximum number of hit points a character has is calculated by adding their rank in Vitality twice and then adding their rank in Will twice. 

For example, if you have 3 ranks in Vitality and 2 ranks in Will, you would add Vitalienergyce, 3+3 = 6. Then add your Will twice, 2+2 = 4. Then add those together, 6+4 = 10. In this example, you would have 10 hit points.

### Hitting 0
A character will inevitably hit 0 hits points at some point. A character's hit points cannot go below 0 and while a character's hit points are 0 they gain 1 stack of the dying condition.

Whenever a character is dying another character may choose to help or finish the other character.

Using the help action on a dying character removes 1 stack of dying from the character.

Finishing a dying character requires another character to attack the dying character. If the dying characters stamina is reduced to 0 and would have delt damage to the dying character, the number of stacks of dying on the dying character are doubled.

##### 0 and Out
After a character has gained enough stacks of dying the character will be made unconscious due to a lack of stamina. The dying character must now make Vitality+Will ability checks at the end of their turn against the number of stacks of dying to remain alive.

A dying and unconscious character that succeeds 3 times becomes stable. A dying and unconscious character that fails 3 times dies.

Whenever a character is dying and unconscious another character may choose to help or finish the other character.

Using the help action on a character that is dying and unconscious costs twice as much stamina and gives an advantage to the dying character's ability check.

Finishing a dying and unconscious character requires another character to attack the dying character. The number of stacks of dying on the dying character are doubled.


# Stamina
Every character has stamina. This is the fuel for action and represents the amount of energy a character has.

The maximum number of stamina a character has is calculated by adding their rank in Vitality twice and then adding their rank in Agility twice. The primary difference between stamina and hit points is how they are used and regained.

Whenever a character uses an [[Basic Actions\|action]] they consume stamina. A basic action uses 1 stamina and some skill actions cost more stamina to be used. Additionally, using more actions costs more stamina by adding the cost of the previous action to the cost of the action they are taking.

For example, your first basic action would cost 1 stamina, your second basic action would cost 1 stamina for your previous action, and 1 stamina for the action, making it cost 2. Your 3rd basic action would cost 2 stamina for your previous action and 1 stamina for the action making the total cost 3. After 3 basic actions are spent you would have spent a total of 1+2+3=6 stamina.

Stamina is reset back to its maximum at the beginning of the character's turn and actions taken on the previous turn no longer effect the cost of actions made on the new turn.

### Hitting 0
There are some situations where a character's maximum stamina hits 0. If this happens, a character can no longer remain conscious and they suffer the unconscious condition.

### Continuous Costs
Some actions have reoccurring or continuous stamina costs. That means there is some cost at the beginning of a characters turn they must pay to continue an action that has some constant benefit. Continuous costs do not appear on basic actions. A continuous cost does count as an action and its cost must be added to your next action.

A continuous cost will be referenced in the skill or item effect and will be marked with a "C" in action cost.

### Quick Actions
There are some points where an action needs to be made extremely quickly and outside of the characters turn. This is known as a quick action. Quick actions cost twice as much as using a regular action on a characters turn and must also include the cost of the last action that character made.

Any action may be used as a quick action and it is encouraged for characters to be creative with how and when they spend their stamina.
