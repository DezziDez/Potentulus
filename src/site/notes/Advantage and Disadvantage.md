# Advantage and Disadvantage
Some skills or situations grant an advantage or make a character suffer a disadvantage. These circumstances can be extremely powerful when used strategically.

A character cannot have more than two advantages or disadvantages stacked together at a time as there are only ever two dice to modify.

Advantage:
- Whenever an character makes a roll with an advantage towards that roll, that character selects their die of the smallest size of that roll, then sets its value to it's maximum. For example: If the character rolls 1d8 and 1d4, then the character would roll 1d8 and add 4 instead of rolling the 1d4.
- Whenever a character makes a roll with 2 advantages, then both dice of the roll are set to their highest value. For example: If the character rolls 1d8 and 1d4, then the character would simply add 8 and 4.

Disadvantage:
- Whenever a character makes a roll with a disadvantage towards that roll, that character selects their die of the smallest size of that roll, then makes its value 1. For example: If the character rolls 1d8 and 1d4, then the character would roll 1d8 and add 1 instead of rolling the 1d4.
- Whenever a character makes a roll with 2 disadvantages, then both dice of the roll are set to 1. For example: If the character rolls 1d8 and 1d4, then the character would simply add 1 and 1.

Both:
- Whenever a character has both an advantage and a disadvantage at the same time, they cancel out and are not counted towards the maximum number of either.
