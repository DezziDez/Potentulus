# Skill Points
Skill points are the things you spend whenever you want to increase the [[Ranks\|rank]] of something. You gain skill points by leveling up.

Whenever you level up, you gain skill points equal to the level gained. So, whenever you level up from 9 to 10 you gain 10 skill points.

# Leveling Up
Every character starts at level 1. If you want to level up, you have to gain experience. Once you have at least 6 experience, you can level up to your next level.

To spend the experience points gained from a level up you need to [[Downtime and Resting\|fully rest]]. Though, you do not need to spend all your skill points at once. They can even be saved for your next full-rest or even your future levels.

# Experience
Experience is awarded by your [[_Potentulus the TTRPG System_#^454d89\|Game Master]] or GM for short. This is the only way you can gain experience.

The game master determines when you have accomplished some goal, a series of goals, or performed some personal achievement that would increase your progress to your next level. The number of experience points will generally range from 0 to 3 in any given session, 1 being the average. That means you should level up about every 6 sessions on average.

If that's to slow for you and your party, you can easily give out more experience every session or decrease the amount of experience needed to level up. As always, it's up to your group!
