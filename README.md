# Potentulus the TTRPG System
Welcome to Potentulus, the fully Modular, infinitely scaling, and open-source tabletop role-playing system. I'm Dez and I'll be walking you through everything here!       ヾ(＠⌒▽⌒＠)ﾉ

I only have a few hard rules that you should always follow.
1. Change It! The system is designed to be altered. Put rules in, take rules out, or change them into something else. Nothing is marked as optional because everything is optional.
2. Make it! If the rules don't support what you want, make your own! The system is completely modular and open-source, so add anything you like and even share it with the world.
3. Break it! Whether player or game master, do whatever you want. The system wants to be bent and broken. Go wild and make the craziest of characters, encounters, items, beasts, or whatever insanity you can come up with.

You will notice that this entire system is inside a, potentially strange, system of pages. I designed and built inside this entire system Obsidian to be plain text, modular, and interconnected. Whenever you see a linked item, it will take you to that page to give you more information!

## Terminology
There are certain words used in this system that are used to convey information as simply as possible. Here are the major ones to assist in reading this system.

#### Character
Everyone is a character. From the snarling wolves to the people the players are playing. The word character refers to any living individual that might make some kind of choice in your world. This word was chosen for its neutral and all-encompassing form.


## Mission Statement
I originally built this system to make something that anyone could pick up, understand, and play with minimal knowledge of math, system overhead, and fully creative freedom.

I wanted something system agnostic that didn't box you in or tell you how to think. I wanted the system to be simple on the surface but get more complex as you get deeper, easing new players into the idea of more and more complex character. Allowing you to play and make good choices without knowing all the rules but still grow and learn along the way.

I also wanted the system and its mechanics to be able to scale up indefinitely to allow for the biggest bosses and highest power fantasies.

All of this is a very difficult balance, like dancing on a tightrope. And while I am not sure if I succeeded in these goals I can sincerely say that an effort was made. And I really hope you enjoy playing and making anything from your imagination with this tool that is Potentulus.

-Dez, The Creator
